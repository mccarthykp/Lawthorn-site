# Lawthorn

Lawthorn is a cloud-based legal automation platform.

## What is a legal automation platform?

Great question! Lawthorn is a hub for all of a law firm's employee's workflows. Each user's Dashboard provides real-time data regarding their daily tasks and immediate access to all of our automation applications specific to their roles.

Our automations relieve employees, at all levels, of their repetive tasks directly related to their individual responsibilites in their firm. 

## Can I see the dashboard?

Not yet! We are currently working on developing The Dashboard and building the features we've found most important to our users during our market research and user-interviews. 

Our informational website, for the time being, is hosted on GitHub Pages here: [Lawthorn](https://mccarthykp.github.io/Lawthorn-site/)

Please feel free to subcribe to our monthly newsletter as we continue developing the platform.
